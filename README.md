# js-todoer-server

A simple todo app.

> Showcases:
>   - electron
>   - express
>   - graphql
>   - mongoose

## Setup

**IMPORTANT**: Since this is a demo app, ``.env`` is provided. However, normally this is not a
secure practice!

``.env`` contains:
- ``NODE_ENV`` - development, test, or production

## Usage

```bash
npm i  # install dependencies
npm start  # run app for dev
npm run electron  # runs electron app: requires dist from js-todoer-client
npm run build  # builds exe for windows:  requires dist from js-todoer-client
```
